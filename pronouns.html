            <p style="text-indent: 2em;">Once you know how to pronounce Ojibwe, the next important step is to learn how the language talks 
            about person. Understanding how person functions is important to form both nouns and verbs. In English we have 7 different 
            pronouns:</p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>I</td>
                    <td>1st person singular</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>we</td>
                    <td>1st person plural</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>you</td>
                    <td>2nd person singular and plural</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>he</td>
                    <td>masculine 3rd person plural</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>she</td>
                    <td>femenine 3rd person plural</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>it</td>
                    <td>neutral 3rd person plural</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>they</td>
                    <td>3rd person plural</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p style="text-indent: 2em;">
            Ojibwe has a slightly more complicated pronoun system:</p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>Niin</td>
                    <td>1st person singular</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Niinawind</td>
                    <td>1st person plural <i>exclusive</i></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Giinawind</td>
                    <td>1st person plural <i>inclusive</i></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Giin</td>
                    <td>2nd person singular</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Giinawaa</td>
                    <td>2nd person plural</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Wiin</td>
                    <td>3rd person singular <i>animate</i></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Wiinawaa</td>
                    <td>3rd person plural <i>animate</i></td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <p style="text-indent: 2em;">1st person plural inclusive would be similar to saying "we" in English and that would include 
                yourself whereas 1st person plural exclusive is "we" but it does not include you. Animate and inanimate are the 
                grammatical cases that are used in Ojibwe similar to Spanish masculine and femenine.
                In addition to these 7 persons specified by pronouns, there are also additional roles that a noun 
                can take. These are: </p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>indefinite or unspecified</td>
                    <td>equivalent to "someone does ___"</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>3rd person animate obviative/4th person</td>
                    <td>when 2+ 3rd person or named nouns are present, the less important one is marked for this</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>3rd person plural inanimate obviative</td>
                    <td>when 2+ 3rd person or named nouns are present, the less important one is marked for this</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>3rd person inanimate obviative/4th person</td>
                    <td>when 2+ 3rd person or named nouns are present, the less important one is marked for this</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>3rd person singular <i>inanimate</i></td>
                    <td>similar to "it" in English or the nouns that would take that place</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>3rd person plural <i>inanimate</i></td>
                    <td>similar to "those things" in English or the nouns that would take that place</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>3rd person animate possessed by obviative</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <p style="text-indent: 2em;">The reason why pronouns are being discussed before either nouns or pronouns is because pronouns 
            are used to modify both of these parts of speech. When indicating possession for something or conjugating intransitive verbs, 
            both the item being possessed and the noun take on the following prefixes (note that 3rd person prefix only goes with nouns).</p>

            <p>It is important to note that depending on the specific dialect, there may be some omissions or changes for this chart, 
                so if you are learning a particular dialect it is important to prioritize that over these charts.
