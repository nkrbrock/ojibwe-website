            <h1>Nouns</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p style = "text-indent: 2em;">Before getting into the more technical aspects of nouns, I feel like I would 
                be doing a disservice to Ojibwe nouns if I didn't bring up one topic in particular: blueberry pie. 
                This word is by far the longest word with 66 letters: miinibaashkiminasiganibiitoosijiganibadagwiingweshiganibakwezhigan.
                I bring this word up because it offers a good representation of an important part of Ojibwe's nature, it is flexible.
                This will not be covered right now as that is a far more advanced topic, but I wanted to mention it now as a topic of interest. 
                When learning Ojibwe nouns, it is important to know that nouns can be placed into one of two different categories: animate 
                or inanimate. These may seem strange, but they operate in a similar manner to how languages such as French, Spanish, or 
                Arabic classify their nouns as either masculine or feminine. It is important to know the distinction between these two 
                types of nouns because not only do they have different plural endings, but they also affect the verb regardless of if 
                they are in the role of subject or object.
            </p>
            <h2>Animate Nouns</h2>
                <p style = "text-indent: 2em;">  
                Animate nouns do not necessarily refer to living things. This is in part true, but it is important to remember that 
                the Ojibwe culture had its own understanding of what made something living. As a result, animate nouns refer to 
                not only people or animals, but spirits, cars, and other things that are capable of movement. Some examples of 
                animate nouns include (bold indicates syllable stress):
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>i<b>ni</b>ni (man)</li>
                    <li>ik<b>we</b> (woman)</li>
                    <li><b>gaa</b>zhagens (cat)</li>
                    <li>ani<b>mosh</b> (dog)</li>
                    <li>mooz (moose)</li>
                    <li>mani<b>doo</b> (spirit)</li>
                    <li><b>wiin</b>digoo (wendigo, cannibal spirit)</li>
                    <li>wiigwaa<b>saa</b>tig (birch)</li>
                </ul>

                <p style = "text-indent: 2em;">Most plural animate nouns always end in a "g".
                </p>
            <h2>Inanimate Nouns</h2>
                <p style = "text-indent: 2em;">
                    Inanimate nouns most often refer to things that are created by people such as chairs, hats, and hammers. Many 
                    natural things are referred to as inanimate as well. Some examples of inanimate nouns include:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>wii<b>wik</b>waan (hat)</li>
                    <li><b>mii</b>kinood (pants)</li>
                    <li>a<b>ki</b> (land, earth)</li>
                    <li>zaaga'<b>i</b>gan (lake)</li>
                </ul>

                <p style = "text-indent: 2em;">
                    Most plural inanimate nouns always end in an "n".
                </p>

                <h2>Mass Nouns</h2>
                <p style= "text-indent: 2em;">Notice how <i>most</i> of animate and inanimate nouns follow a particular pattern to 
                indicate plurality. This is because some nouns from both categories are mass nouns. That is, they are nouns that are 
                used for objects that are difficult to quanify such as <i>nibi</i> (water). These words still have a grammatical gender, 
                but they do not have a plural form to easily identify this. Instead, you have to look for the other traits mentioned 
                above or the context to determine which category it belongs to.</p>
                
                <p>Below is an activity that will give you some practice with real Ojibwe words. Because activities on this site are 
                    not timed, it is highly recommended that you take the time to learn the words in these activities as they are meant 
                    to not only test what has been covered, but to expand your vocabulary as well. (Capitalization indicates word 
                    stress.)
